# StreetFighter
![](/Assets/streetfighter.png)

## About  
- One of the best childhood memories back then, that used to be played with lots of excitement and enjoyment.
- This is my own lite version of street fighter that I have developed during my technical-training.  
- Only Consists of fight between ``Ryu`` vs ``Ken``.  

## Motivation
- Implementation of the understanding regarding ``OOPs`` which is being taught as a part of the technical-training program.
- To understand the concept that ``how classes do communicate with each other``.  

## Why this game ?
- Interest.
- Curiousity: how do classes communicate in such type of fighting based games.

## Language Implemented
